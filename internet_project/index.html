		<h2>Clients and Servers</h2>
		<p>Computers connected to the Web are called clients and servers.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Clients</span> are the typical user's Inernet-connected devices (or example, your computer conneted to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your monile network) and <span>Web-accessing software</span> available on those devices (usually a web browser liske Firefox or Chrome).</li>
			<li><span>Servers</span> are computers that store <span>webpages, sites, or apps.</span> When a client devices wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>So What Actually Happens?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the websie lives on.</li>
			<li>The browser send and HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
			<li>If the server apprives the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
			<li>The brower assembles the small chunks into complete website and displays it to you!</li>
