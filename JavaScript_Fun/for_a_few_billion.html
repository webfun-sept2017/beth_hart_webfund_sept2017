There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward. The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double, starting with a penny. (1 penny for the first day, 2 for the second, 4 for the third, then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on).

Use for loops to answer the following:

How much was the reward after 30 days?
remember, a penny isn't 1, but 0.01

Bonus (Only If You Have Time):

How many days would it take the servant to make $10,000?
How about 1 billion?
In JavaScript, there is a value Infinity . How many days until the servant has infinite money?
